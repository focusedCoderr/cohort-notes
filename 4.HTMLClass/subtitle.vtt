Welcome to this quick introduction to HTML.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In this video, you'll learn the basics of how web pages are structured.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It’s the standard language used to create the content of web pages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let’s start with the basic structure of an HTML document.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Every HTML file begins with a doctype and the `<html>` tag.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Inside the `<html>`, we have two main parts: the `<head>` and the `<body>`.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The `<head>` contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and the page title.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The `<body>` contains all the visible content shown on the page.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let’s now add a heading using the `<h1>` tag.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Next, we’ll add a paragraph using the `<p>` tag.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
These tags help structure your content so browsers can display it correctly.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There are also semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They help give meaning to the different parts of your page.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now you know the basic structure of an HTML page!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Keep practicing and you’ll be building full webpages in no time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
