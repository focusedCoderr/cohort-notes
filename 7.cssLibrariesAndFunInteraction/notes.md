- Before starting a new css file do this :

```html
<style>
	* {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
		box-sizing: border-box;
	}
</style>
```

- This will cascade the styling applied by the browser and we can do our own styling. Browser styling will not interfere with our styling.
- css selector
- suppose there is a nav and inside it a div and inside it a ul, so to target this ul instead of using any class we can also select it like this:

- ```css
  nav div ul {
  	display: flex;
  }
  ```
- `cursor: pointer` -> used a lot of times
- `nav div button:hover{}` : to define what happens when you hover over a button
- `object-fit: cover` : study this
- `section` tag : understand.
- understand media queries
