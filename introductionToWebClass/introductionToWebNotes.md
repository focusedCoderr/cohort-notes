1. check dns server of your browser
2. question: i think the router has assigned a dns server. so if that is correct how can a browser have a dns server. or does the system has a dns server? i am talking about the operating system. research....who checks for the dns server. i think when i type a website address in the browser...it is the duty of the browser to go to the nearest dns server and resolve that name into ip address.

dns server sends the request to the neearest root server.
there are 13 root name servers in the world.
how does tls handshake happens: how a tls certificate is created.
